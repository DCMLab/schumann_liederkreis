Attempting to parse op39n04.mscx
MC 1 seems to be a pickup measure but has not been excluded from bar count!
Done parsing op39n04.mscx

The following chords could not be parsed:
    mc  mn onset    label
ix                       
13  12  12   5/8  .bIII.V
Failed to expand labels due to syntactic errors:
repl_spec() missing 1 required positional argument: 'special'
